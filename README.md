# Udacity_DS_Write_A_Data_Science_Blog_Post - 

## Key Steps for Project
Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1) Pick a dataset.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

Prepare data:

Gather necessary data to answer your questions
Handle categorical and missing data
Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.
4) Communicate your business insights:

Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
Your deliverables will be a Github repo and a blog post. Use the rubric here to assist in successfully completing this project!


# Airbnb New York City Exploratory DataÂ Analysis

## Introduction
Funded in 2008, Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. According to its website, Airbnb's accommodation marketplace provides access to 7 million unique places to stay in more than 100,000 cities and 191 countries and regions.

New York City (NYC) is one of the hottest Airbnb markets. With over 8 million population distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles, it becomes the most densely populated major city in the United States. In this post, I will conduct exploratory data analysis of the Airbnb New York City dataset and answer the following questions:

Market Review.
What is the total listing?
What is the average price?
How many hosts in NYC?
How many neighborhoods in NYC?
What is the listing for each year?
The relationship between listing, price and NYC boroughs.
Which borough has the most listing?
Which borough has the highest average daily price?
The relationship between listing, price and NYC neighborhood.
Which neighborhood has the most listing?
Which neighborhood has the highest average daily price?
The relationship between listing, price and property type.
Which property type has the most listing?
Which property type has the highest average daily price?
Correlation between daily price and key metrics.

## Dataset 
Airbnb New York City Dataset comes from Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), which is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. The dataset I am using in this post was named as listing.csv, which was compiled on 9/12/2019.
